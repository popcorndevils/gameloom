# Game Loom
This is a personal project for a tool I use to help me prepare and run TTRPG games.  The components of this application are things I've written little jupyter notebooks over the years to help me with, but it's about time I join them into one project.  All of this is subject to change, I've already changed the application's name like 3 times.  Expect no support, or even a response if you care to engage at all.  

# Instructions  
With python/pip installed:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

You can then run the project with `python main.py`

## Art Clipper
The art clipper is for browsing pdfs and extracting embedded art for use in VTTs.

## Lore Keeper
Lore keeper will provide users with a way to record TTRPG sessions, and submit the audio to an AI model for transcription.  The transcript can then be used to generate session notes, along with suggestions for how to prep for the next session.
